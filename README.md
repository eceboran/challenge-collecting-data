# challenge-collecting-data

## Description
This project is a part of the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) programme. The task is to build a basis for a dataset for the real estate company "ImmoEliza", which wants to create a machine learning model to make price predictions on real estate sales in Belgium. The dataset should consist of 10000 inputs of data from all of Belgium and be provided in a .csv format. The dataset must be clean and, as much as possible, contain mostly numerical/binary values.

This is the first web scraping project within the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) to test our understanding of webscraping with Python (approx. 4 weeks from the start of the programme). The full duration of the BeCode programme is 7 months. 

## Personal situation
We are currently participating in the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) to upskill into a career in data science.
